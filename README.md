TODO list
* Refactor animation code, very unclean right now
* For movement, change from events to states?
* Be able to move diagonally?

* Decide on how to do rendering, either:
  * Player class have a renderPlayer(Renderer * renderer); function
  * Game class has a renderPlayer(Player * player) function.
  * Create a renderer class?
