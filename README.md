Welcome to my nth pet project!

TL;DR
It's a 2D game / game engine.

It currently handles and supports: rendering, animation, player movement and basic collision detection
(although I plan to add more)

Tech stack / requirements
* C++ compiler
* SDL2 graphics library
* A build tool (e.g. Makefile or CMake)
