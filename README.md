TODO list
* Fix diagonal behaviour so distance travelled is constant.
* Interactable map. E.g. sow plants, open chest, use terminal

* Decide on how to do rendering, either:
  * Player class have a renderPlayer(Renderer * renderer); function
  * Game class has a renderPlayer(Player * player) function.
  * Create a renderer class?
